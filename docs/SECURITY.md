## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within GoShare, please report it immediately.

**Direct Transfers**: Note that in P2P mode, files are transferred directly between browsers and are never stored or seen by the GoShare server. However, if you find a vulnerability in the signaling or LAN discovery logic, please let us know.

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues. Instead, please email the maintainers at [your-email-here].

We take security seriously and will respond to reports as quickly as possible.
